## Goals

The goal of this project is to provide React Native developers with a seamless experience in using certain mobile-friendly components from headless UI packages, without the cognitive stress of significant alterations. Thus, most of the input, output, and concepts of headless UI components can be utilized without major adjustments.

## Non-Goals

It's important to note that this project does not aim to support every feature of [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com). For instance, regarding the "as" property, it can generally be used to change to other React Native components. However, components like Modals, which have predefined roles and encapsulate the entire modal, cannot be changed using the `as` property.

This revision keeps the original intent while ensuring clarity and coherence in English.
