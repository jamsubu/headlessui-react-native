# Modal (Dialog)

## Installation

To get started, install Headless UI via npm:

```
npm install headlessui-react-native
```

## Basic example

Modals are built using the `Modal`, `ModalPanel`, and `ModalTitle` components:

<iframe
  src={`${SHOWCASE_HOST}/components/modal`}
  width="100%"
  height="400px"
></iframe>

```jsx file=<rootDir>/node_modules/headlessui-react-native-example-ui/src/modal/modal-example.tsx

```

## Examples

### Different enter/leave transitions

### Coordinating multiple transitions

### Transitioning on initial mount

## Component API

### Transition

| Prop          | Default    | Description                                                                          |
| :------------ | :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `as`          | `Fragment` | `String` The element the transition should render as.                                |
| `show`        | â€”          | `Boolean` Whether the children should be shown or hidden.                            |
| `appear`      | `false`    | `Boolean` Whether the transition should run on initial mount.                        |
| `unmount`     | `true`     | `Boolean` Whether the element should be unmounted or hidden based on the show state. |
| `beforeEnter` | -          | `() => void` Callback which is called before we start the enter transition.          |
| `afterEnter`  | -          | `() => void` Callback which is called after we finished the enter transition.        |
| `beforeLeave` | -          | `() => void` Callback which is called before we start the leave transition.          |
| `afterLeave`  | -          | `() => void` Callback which is called after we finished the leave transition.        |

### TransitionChild

| Prop          | Default    | Description                                                                          |
| :------------ | :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `as`          | `Fragment` | `String` The element the transition child should render as.                          |
| `appear`      | `false`    | `Boolean` Whether the transition should run on initial mount.                        |
| `unmount`     | `true`     | `Boolean` Whether the element should be unmounted or hidden based on the show state. |
| `beforeEnter` | -          | `() => void` Callback which is called before we start the enter transition.          |
| `afterEnter`  | -          | `() => void` Callback which is called after we finished the enter transition.        |
| `beforeLeave` | -          | `() => void` Callback which is called before we start the leave transition.          |
| `afterLeave`  | -          | `() => void` Callback which is called after we finished the leave transition.        |
