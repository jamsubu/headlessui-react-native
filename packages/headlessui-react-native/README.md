# Headlessui React Native

This is an unstyled, accessible headless UI library for React Native.

If you have nativewind installed, you can also use tailwind. Visit following website to see the full API documentation https://headlessui-react-native.vercel.app

## Goals

The goal of this project is to provide React Native developers with a seamless experience in using certain mobile-friendly components from headless UI packages, without the cognitive stress of significant alterations. Thus, most of the input, output, and concepts of headless UI components can be utilized without major adjustments.

## Non-Goals

It's important to note that this project does not aim to support every feature. For instance, regarding the "as" property, which allows manipulation of tags, it's not feasible to replace tags due to accessibility issues and the varying behavior of React Native components. However, partial compatibility is supported in some cases. For example, while the default for "modalContent" is View, it can be changed to ScrollView.
